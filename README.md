🚦 NYC Collisions Analysis

A data science project exploring motor vehicle collisions in New York City.
We clean, analyze, and model data from over 230K collision records to uncover insights on safety, geography, and contributing factors.

📊 Project Highlights

Data Size: 238K+ collision records

Scope: Borough-level trends, contributing factors, seasonal effects

Methods:

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Statistical inference (t-tests, ANOVA, correlations)

Introductory machine learning (linear regression)

Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, scikit-learn

⚙️ Installation

Clone this repo and set up a virtual environment:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/nyc-collisions.git
cd nyc-collisions
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


If you don’t have a requirements.txt, install dependencies manually:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn jupyter

🚀 Usage

Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook DSC_PROJECT_FINALLY.ipynb


Update the dataset path if needed. Replace the Colab-style path:

pd.read_excel("/content/dsc project nyc.xlsx")


with:

pd.read_excel("dsc project nyc.xlsx")


Run cells top to bottom to reproduce the analysis.

📈 Sample Results

Some of the insights generated by this project:

🚗 Brooklyn & Queens lead in collisions and injuries.

📱 Driver inattention/distraction is the most common contributing factor.

☀️ Accidents peak in summer months.

🔗 Injury counts for motorists show strong correlations with total injuries.

Example visualization (from notebook):


(Replace with actual plot or screenshot from your notebook.)

🔬 Methods

Data Cleaning: Missing value handling, imputation, and outlier filtering

Exploratory Analysis: Distributions, borough comparisons, geographic scatterplots

Statistical Testing: t-test on contributing factors, ANOVA across boroughs, correlation analysis

Regression Model: Linear regression predicting injuries based on location
